						<h3 class="faq">Where are you located?</h3><br>
						<p class="faq">We offer multiple camps to choose from. Whether you are looking for the wonderful blue skies of the University of Southern California to the breathtaking views of the east at Northwestern University, we offer many camps to fit your needs! You can select a program that best suits your childâ€™s passions.
</p><br>
						<h3 class="faq">What makes Brefillion Camps different from the rest?</h3><br>
						<p class="faq">At Brefillion Camps, we focus on developing leadership and teamwork as a part of holistic character building. With us, your child will learn the necessary skills to survive in the wilderness and while developing valuable competency in the technical sciences. </p><br>
						<h3 class="faq">Where does my child sleep?</h3><br>
						<p class="faq">We pride ourselves on our state-of-the-art lodging residences. Camp dwellings are newly constructed and regularly maintained by our qualified staff. Campers will also have the opportunity to sleep under the stars during wilderness outings and nature trips.</p><br>
						<h3 class="faq">Where do I drop off my child?</h3><br>
						<p class="faq">We are happy to accommodate all forms of travel to and from camp. If you decide to fly, call us in advance to schedule a pickup from the airpot. Although we recommend your child bring his/her phone for the travel portion of the trip, we strongly believe that cellphones distract from your child's maximum learning capabilities. Mobile electronic devices are collected at the beginning of all sessions, unless the device is crucial to your child's health.</p><br>
						<h3 class="faq">If my child doesnt like the camp, am I entitled to a refund?</h3><br>
						<p class="faq">Unfortunately, after completion of a session, we cannot offer a refund. However, you may call us to cancel your reservation up to 72 hours in advance of the session.</p><br>
						<h3 class="faq">Are your camp counselers trustworthy?</h3><br>
						<p class="faq">Yes - our counselors are outstanding! All counselors are trained in first aid and CPR and are monitored by camp staff for any inappropriate conduct. We only select the best candidates for the job. Those who work with us know how lucky they are to get to experience the wonders of Brefillion Camps! </p><br>
